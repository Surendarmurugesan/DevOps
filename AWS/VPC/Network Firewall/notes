AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy essential network protections for all of your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)

It is the stateful, managed, network firewall & intrusion detection and prevention service for your VPC.

It checks the traffic flow from inbound & outbound.

Security flow order::
    order
    1   Network Firewall    = Configure with VPC (next to internet gateway) Refer the architecture.(Based Priority ID)
    2   NACL                = Configure with subnet level (Based Priority ID)
    3   Security Groups     = Configure with AWS resource

Here, we configure the edge associations, not subnet associations

Order of Evalution (Network firewall rule groups)::
    1   Stateless rule (It checks the stateless rules first, if it's not available, then it move to Stateful rules) if not traffic will denied.
    2   Stateful rule

    We can filter with specific IP, subnet range, Org IP, Domain name. (Allow/Deny the rule)
