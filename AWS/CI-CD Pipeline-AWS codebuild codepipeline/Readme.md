# CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, and AWS CodeBuild for automating the build, test, and deployment process of a web application. 

Here's a detailed guide:

## Step 1: Set up an AWS CodeCommit Repository

- Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeCommit service.
- Click on "Create repository" and provide a name and optional description for your repository.
- Configure the repository settings as per your requirements and click on "Create repository".


## Step 2: Create an AWS CodeBuild Project

- Go to the AWS CodeBuild service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click on "Create build project" to start creating a new CodeBuild project.
- Give your project a name and select the appropriate source provider (CodeCommit).
- Choose the repository you created in Step 1 from the dropdown.
- Configure the build settings, such as the runtime environment, build specifications, and artifacts output.
- Customize the build environment as needed and click on "Create build project".

## Step 3: Configure AWS CodePipeline

- Navigate to the AWS CodePipeline service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click on "Create pipeline" to begin creating a new pipeline.
- Provide a name for your pipeline and click on "Next".
- In the Source stage, select AWS CodeCommit as the source provider and choose the repository you created in Step 1.
- Configure the build stage by selecting AWS CodeBuild as the build provider and choose the project you created in Step 2.
- Customize the build settings and click on "Next".
- In the Deploy stage, select the deployment provider appropriate for your web application, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Amazon S3.
- Configure the deployment settings based on your chosen deployment provider.
- Review the pipeline configuration and click on "Create pipeline" to create the pipeline.

## Step 4: Set up Webhooks (Optional)

- In the CodeCommit repository, go to the "Settings" tab and click on "Triggers".
- Click on "Add trigger" and select the "AWS CodePipeline" trigger type.
- Choose the pipeline you created in Step 3 and configure the trigger settings as desired.
- Save the trigger configuration.

## Step 5: Test and Deploy

- Push your web application code to the CodeCommit repository. This will trigger the pipeline to start.
- AWS CodePipeline will automatically retrieve the source code, initiate the build process using CodeBuild, and then deploy the application based on your deployment configuration.
- Monitor the pipeline execution in the CodePipeline console and review the build and deployment logs for any errors or issues.
- Once the pipeline completes successfully, your web application will be deployed and ready to use.

That's it! You have successfully set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, and AWS CodeBuild to automate the build, test, and deployment process of your web application.
