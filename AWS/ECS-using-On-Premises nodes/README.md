# ECS Anywhere

### Scenario
Customers running hybrid workloads is to keep configurations and secrets in AWS cloud and pull them on-demand when required. 
How we can integrate SSM parameter store and AWS Secrets manager with ECS tasks running outside AWS cloud(On-Premises)?
How we can create a continuous integration and delivery pipeline (CI/CD) for applications deployed outside AWS cloud using ECS-anywhere?

We will use CodeCommit, CodeBuild and CodePipeline along with AWS ECR to build this pipeline.
