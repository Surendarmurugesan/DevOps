# Install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.

# Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:

# This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

# Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:
# Welcome to Nautilus Group!

# Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.

# The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

# The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0755 on all app servers.

# Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
