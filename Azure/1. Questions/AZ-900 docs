Difference between Azure App services & Azure functions ?
    App Service is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering.

    Azure functions are concerned only about the code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.

What is Azure Batch?

What's the main difference between stateless and stateful?
    In Stateless, server is not needed to keep the server information or session details to itself. In stateful, a server is required to maintain the current state and session information.

Functions vs Logic Apps
    Functions and Logic Apps can both create complex orchestrations. An orchestration is a collection of functions or steps that are executed to accomplish a complex task.

    With Functions, you write code to complete each step.
    With Logic Apps, you use a GUI to define the actions and how they relate to one another.

1. Azure App Service to create your website front-ends.
2. Azure Functions to create event-driven application logic that only runs when you need it.
3. Azure Virtual Desktop to quickly provide a customized operating system and software environment for your remote workers.
