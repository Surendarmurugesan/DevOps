# There is a production deployment planned for next week. 
# The Nautilus DevOps team wants to test the deployment update and rollback on 
# Dev environment first so that they can identify the risks in advance. 
# Below you can find more details about the plan they want to execute.

# Create a namespace nautilus. 
# Create a deployment called httpd-deploy under this new namespace, It should have 
# one container called httpd, use httpd:2.4.25 image and 4 replicas. 
# The deployment should use RollingUpdate strategy with maxSurge=1, and maxUnavailable=2. 
# Also create a NodePort type service named httpd-service and expose the deployment on nodePort: 30008.

#  Now upgrade the deployment to version httpd:2.4.43 using a rolling update.

#  Finally, once all pods are updated undo the recent update and roll back to the previous/original version.
