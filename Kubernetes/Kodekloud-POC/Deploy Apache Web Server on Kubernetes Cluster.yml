# There is an application that needs to be deployed on Kubernetes cluster under Apache web server. The Nautilus application development team has asked the DevOps team to 
# deploy it. We need to develop a template as per requirements mentioned below:

# 1. Create a namespace named as httpd-namespace-datacenter.
# 2. Create a deployment named as httpd-deployment-datacenter under newly created namespace. For the deployment use httpd image with latest tag only and remember to mention the 
# tag i.e httpd:latest, and make sure replica counts are 2.

# 3. Create a service named as httpd-service-datacenter under same namespace to expose the deployment, nodePort should be 30004.
