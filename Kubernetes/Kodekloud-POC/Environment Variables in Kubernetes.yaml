# There are a number of parameters that are used by applications. We need to define these as environment variables so that we can use them as 
# needed within different configs. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.

# Create a namespace named as fieldref-namespace.

# Create a pod named envars-fieldref under the namespace fieldref-namespace.

# Configure spec as the container name should be fieldref-container, use image nginx preferable latest tag, use command 'sh', '-c' and args 
# should be 'while true; do echo -en '/n'; printenv NODE_NAME POD_NAME POD_NAMESPACE; printenv POD_IP POD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT; sleep 10; done;'

# (Note: please take care of indentations)
# Define five environment variables as mentioned below:
# a.) The first env should be named as NODE_NAME, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath should be spec.nodeName.
# b.) The second env should be named as POD_NAME, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath should be metadata.name.
# c.) The third env should be named as POD_NAMESPACE, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath should be metadata.namespace.
# d.) The fourth env should be named as POD_IP, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath should be status.podIP.
# e.) The fifth env should be named as POD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT, set valueFrom fieldref and fieldPath shoulbe be spec.serviceAccountName.
# Set restart policy to Never.
# To check the output, exec the pod and use printenv command.
# Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
